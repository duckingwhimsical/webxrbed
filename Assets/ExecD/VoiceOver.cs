    Ugh, too early, maybe I can sleep more.
        There's nothing worth getting up for
    I can never get back to sleep
    I could watch something
        It's not worth finding the remote
    There's no more episodes of that series
        Too tired to get up
    I guess I should get up though
        I just can't
    It's not like they need me at work
    Johnny will cover my work
    He'll be pissed though
    Shit, they, they'll be pissed
    Why can't I remember their damn pronouns
    Probably be pissed whether I come in or not
    Doesn't matter. If I keep ditching I'm going to get fired
